# MazeGenerator-Solver

This was a project for my CS201 Data Structures class. This project can generate a random amze and show the solution to any maze generated by this project. All I/O is done from the command line.

## Getting Started

This program can be run from any directory using the command line. First, compile the project using `make`. The executable is named **amaze**. The executable takes the following arguments:

-v                 gives author's name; the program exits
                   immediately after the name is printed.

-s III OOO         solves the maze in file III placing
                   the solution in file OOO.

-c RRR CCC MMM     creates a maze with RRR rows and CCC
                   columns, placing the maze in file MMM.

-r NNN             seeds a pseudo-random number generator
                   with NNN; if the -r option is not given,
                   a random seed of 1 is used.

-d III             draws the created maze ( -c) or draws the
                   solved maze ( -s) found in file III.

For example, to create a 5 x 7 cell maze and save it in file my_maze, enter `amaze -c 5 7 my_maze`. To see the solution to this maze, enter `amaze -s my_maze maze_solution`. Finally, to display a maze (either solved or unsolved), enter `amaze -d maze_solution`. Solved mazed are displayed with the steps taken in the bredth-first search algorithm used to solve them.

To clean your directory, use `make clean`.
